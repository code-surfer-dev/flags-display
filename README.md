# Description

The MARZA Microprocessor Trainer uses static RAM instead of dynamic RAM. Since
the /RFSH output signal of the Z80 microprocessor is solely intended for
refreshing dynamic RAMs, it is available for other uses in the trainer.

There is a /RFSH signal generated by the Z80 microprocessor during every third
cycle (T3) of the instruction fetch machine cycle (M1). Combining /RFSH and
/MEMRQ with a physical hardware switch representing the /DEBUG function active
signal via a pair of OR gates (74xx32), generates an interrupt on the /INT
maskable interrupt control input of the Z80. The Z80 is set to interrupt mode 1,
and the default interrupt handler for mode 1 interrupts is at address 38h.

The interrupt handler at 38h is a subroutine that pushes the the current
contents of the BC register pair and the AF register pair (Accumulator & Flags
registers) onto the stack. The BC register pair is pushed onto the stack to
preserve their values since they are altered by the subroutine. The subroutine
then outputs the value of the accumulator onto two seven segment displays
connected via two hexadecimal seven segment LED display drivers (9368) to PORT B
of a PIO, and the value of the flags register onto a bar graph LED via PORT A of
a PIO.
