# Description

Attempt to use an interrupt generated by a PIO to call a subroutine that
displays the contents of the accumulator and the flags register on two seven
segment displays connected to PORT A of the PIO, and a bar graph LED connected
to PORT B of the PIO respectively.

The hardware has a switch to enable/disable this functionality, as part of the
MARZA Microprocessor Trainer.
